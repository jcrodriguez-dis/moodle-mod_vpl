Code lines start with '>' (e.g., ">   return value > 0")
File references use: filename:line[:column] 1-based indexing
Use clear, educational language

Example:
- Issue in function fibo
main.py:5:10 Error variable 'x' is undefined

- You are using bad varaible names
src/main.cpp:25 The variable 'aux' in function init may be named as first
src/util.cpp:37 The variable 'nosense' in function sum may be named as total

- Fix Suggestion for mult
main.py:10 Add check for negative values
