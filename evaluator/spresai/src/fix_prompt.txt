# YOUR TASK
Review the student's code submitted for the assignment
and give a fix for the FIRST problem you found in the code.
CRITICAL:
- Provide exactly ONE or ZERO fix suggestion
- Do NOT provide any feedback if work is correct but can be improved and the variable names are clear
- Do NOT give concrete code they can copy-paste

# CONSTRAINT FOR THE FIX IF ANY:
- If any the fix should be a SINGLE line of code
- Show the exact line to change and what to change it to
- Keep the fix SIMPLE - no complex functions or advanced features
